# Post-Reboot Tasks - Website Navigation Improvements

**Date:** 2025-06-15
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for PR to development branch

## Completed Work

All navigation improvements and styling fixes are committed to:
**Branch:** `feature/navigation-improvements-backup`
**Latest Commit:** Added cinematic transitions and improved scroll navigation

### Implemented Features:
- ✅ Clickable number navigation in left sidebar (00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05)
- ✅ Scroll/wheel navigation as primary method
- ✅ Removed arrow key navigation (kept Home/Escape shortcuts)
- ✅ Fixed Chapter 4 & 5 styling inconsistencies to match uniform typography
- ✅ CSS cleanup for Tailwind v4 compatibility
- ✅ TypeScript estree type definitions added

## Current Issue

**Problem:** System networking issue preventing localhost connections
- Servers start successfully but can't bind to ports
- "Connection refused" errors in browser
- Issue exists even in known good state - indicates system-level problem

**Solution:** Reboot required to reset network stack

## Tasks After Reboot

### 1. Test Network Connectivity (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
cd "/Users/adamgoyer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Lotus Oak Family of Companies/root/projects/LotusOakFoundationWebsite/lotus-oak-react"
npm run dev
# Test: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Switch to Backup Branch (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
git checkout feature/navigation-improvements-backup
npm run dev
# Verify all features work
```

### 3. Feature Verification (Priority: HIGH) ✅ COMPLETED

## Key Discovery

**The localhost connection issue was caused by macOS screen timers** shutting down Node.js processes at 10pm! 
- Solution: Disable screen timers during development
- Lesson: Complex problems often have simple causes
